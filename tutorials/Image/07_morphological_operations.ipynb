    "# Morphological Operations\n",
    "Earth Engine implements morphological operations as focal operations, specifically `focal_max()`, `focal_min()`, `focal_median()`, and `focal_mode()` instance methods in the `Image` class. (These are shortcuts for the more general `reduceNeighborhood()`, which can input the pixels in a kernel to any reducer with a numeric output. See [this page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reducers_reduce_neighborhood) for more information on reducing neighborhoods). The morphological operators are useful for performing operations such as erosion, dilation, opening and closing. For example, to perform an [opening operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_(morphology)), use `focal_min()` followed by `focal_max()`:"

    "## Install Earth Engine API and geemap\n",
    "Install the [Earth Engine Python API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install) and [geemap](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap). The **geemap** Python package is built upon the [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) and [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) packages and implements several methods for interacting with Earth Engine data layers, such as `Map.addLayer()`, `Map.setCenter()`, and `Map.centerObject()`.\n",
    "The following script checks if the geemap package has been installed. If not, it will install geemap, which automatically installs its [dependencies](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap#dependencies), including earthengine-api, folium, and ipyleaflet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: A key difference between folium and ipyleaflet is that ipyleaflet is built upon ipywidgets and allows bidirectional communication between the front-end and the backend enabling the use of the map to capture user input, while folium is meant for displaying static data only ([source](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-gis-in-jupyter-with-ipyleaflet-52f9657fa7a)). Note that [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) currently does not support ipyleaflet ([source](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/60#issuecomment-596225619)). Therefore, if you are using geemap with Google Colab, you should use [`import geemap.foliumap`](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/geemap/foliumap.py). If you are using geemap with [binder](https://mybinder.org/) or a local Jupyter notebook server, you can use [`import geemap`](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/geemap/geemap.py), which provides more functionalities for capturing user input (e.g., mouse-clicking and moving)."

geemap could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official geemap docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/giswqs/geemap/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.

  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `geemap` for local development.

1. Fork the `geemap` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/geemap.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv geemap
    $ cd geemap/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 geemap tests
    $ python setup.py test or pytest
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.com/giswqs/geemap/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::


    $ python -m unittest tests.test_geemap

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.

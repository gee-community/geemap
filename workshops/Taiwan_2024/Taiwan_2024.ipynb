    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed for workshop presented at the [Center for GIS, RCHSS, Academia Sinica](https://gis.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/), Taiwan, on August 7, 2024. Part 1 of the workshop will introduce the Earth Engine Python API and the geemap Python package. Part 2 will focus on 3D mapping with Leafmap and MapLibre. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To use geemap and the Earth Engine Python API, you must [register](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) for an Earth Engine account and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGSmrNm6_baqd8CHt33kIBWOlvkh-HLr46bODgJN1h0/edit?usp=sharing) to create a Cloud Project. Earth Engine is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). To test whether you can use authenticate the Earth Engine Python API, please run [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/docs/notebooks/geemap_colab.ipynb) on Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is recommended that attendees have a basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "-   Familiarity with the Earth Engine JavaScript API is not required but will be helpful.\n",
    "-   Attendees can use Google Colab to follow this short course without installing anything on their computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "The main topics to be covered in this workshop include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create interactive maps\n",
    "* Visualize Earth Engine data\n",
    "* Explore Earth Engine Data Catalogs\n",
    "* Analyze Earth Engine data\n",
    "* Export Earth Engine data\n",
    "* Create timelapse animations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Earth Engine and geemap\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth Engine is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). For more than a decade, Earth Engine has enabled planetary-scale Earth data science and analysis by nonprofit organizations, research scientists, and other impact users.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the launch of Earth Engine for [commercial use](https://earthengine.google.com/commercial), commercial customers will be charged for Earth Engine services. However, Earth Engine will remain free of charge for noncommercial use and research projects. Nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, educators, news media, Indigenous governments, and government researchers are eligible to use Earth Engine free of charge, just as they have done for over a decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geemap Python package is built upon the Earth Engine Python API and open-source mapping libraries. It allows Earth Engine users to interactively manipulate, analyze, and visualize geospatial big data in a Jupyter environment. Since its creation in April 2020, geemap has received over 3,300 GitHub stars and is being used by over 2,700 projects on GitHub.\n",

    "## Google Colab and Earth Engine Python API authentication\n",

    "### Change Colab dark theme\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, ipywidgets does not work well with Colab dark theme. Some of the geemap widgets may not display properly in Colab dark theme.It is recommended that you change Colab to the light theme.\n",

    "The geemap package is pre-installed in Google Colab and is updated to the latest minor or major release every few weeks. Some optional dependencies of geemap being used by this notebook are not pre-installed in Colab. Uncomment the following code block to install geemap and some optional dependencies."

One important piece of information is the Image/ImageCollection/FeatureCollection ID of each dataset, which is essential for accessing the dataset through the Earth Engine JavaScript or Python APIs.\n",

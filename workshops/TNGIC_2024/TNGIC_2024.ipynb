    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop provides and introduction to cloud-based geospatial analysis using the Earth Engine Python API. Attendees will learn the basics of Earth Engine data types and how to visualize, analyze, and export data in a Jupyter environment with Geemap. Through practical examples and hands-on exercises, attendees will enhance their learning experience. Familiarity with Earth Engine JavaScript API is not required but will be helpful. Attendees can use Google Colab to follow this workshop without downloading anything on their computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To use geemap and the Earth Engine Python API, you must [register](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) for an Earth Engine account and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGSmrNm6_baqd8CHt33kIBWOlvkh-HLr46bODgJN1h0/edit?usp=sharing) to create a Cloud Project. Earth Engine is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). To test whether you can use authenticate the Earth Engine Python API, please run [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/docs/notebooks/geemap_colab.ipynb) on Google Colab.\n",

    "\n",
    "Earth Engine is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). For more than a decade, Earth Engine has enabled planetary-scale Earth data science and analysis by nonprofit organizations, research scientists, and other impact users.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the launch of Earth Engine for [commercial use](https://earthengine.google.com/commercial), commercial customers will be charged for Earth Engine services. However, Earth Engine will remain free of charge for noncommercial use and research projects. Nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, educators, news media, Indigenous governments, and government researchers are eligible to use Earth Engine free of charge, just as they have done for over a decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geemap Python package is built upon the Earth Engine Python API and open-source mapping libraries. It allows Earth Engine users to interactively manipulate, analyze, and visualize geospatial big data in a Jupyter environment. Since its creation in April 2020, geemap has received over 3,100 GitHub stars and is being used by over 1,000 projects on GitHub.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) hosts a variety of geospatial datasets. As of October 2023, the catalog contains over [1,000 datasets](https://github.com/opengeos/Earth-Engine-Catalog/blob/master/gee_catalog.tsv) with a total size of over 80 petabytes. Some notable datasets include: Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, NAIP, etc. For a complete list of datasets in CSV or JSON formats, see the [Earth Engine Datasets List](https://github.com/giswqs/Earth-Engine-Catalog/blob/master/gee_catalog.tsv).\n",

    "#### Searching for datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog) is searchable. You can search datasets by name, keyword, or tag. For example, enter \"elevation\" in the search box will filter the catalog to show only datasets containing \"elevation\" in their name, description, or tags. 52 datasets are returned for this search query. Scroll down the list to find the [NASA SRTM Digital Elevation 30m](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_SRTMGL1_003#description) dataset. On each dataset page, you can find the following information, including Dataset Availability, Dataset Provider, Earth Engine Snippet, Tags, Description, Code Example, and more (see {numref}`ch03_gee_srtm`). One important piece of information is the Image/ImageCollection/FeatureCollection ID of each dataset, which is essential for accessing the dataset through the Earth Engine JavaScript or Python APIs.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the materials for the first part of the workshop **Geospatial Cloud Computing with the GEE Python API** at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop provides an introduction to cloud-based geospatial analysis using the Earth Engine Python API. Attendees will learn the basics of Earth Engine data types and how to visualize, analyze, and export Earth Engine data in a Jupyter environment with geemap. In addition, attendees will learn how to develop and deploy interactive Earth Engine web apps with Python. Through practical examples and hands-on exercises, attendees will enhance their learning experience. During each hands-on session, attendees will walk through Jupyter Notebook examples on Google Colab with the instructors. At the end of each session, they will complete a hands-on exercise to apply the knowledge they have learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop is divided into three parts. The first part will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Introduction to Google Earth Engine (including GEE Data Catalog)\n",
    "-   Getting started with Geemap (Environment set up, package installation, Google Colab)\n",
    "-   Introduction to Geemap core features\n",
    "-   Finding help on GEE and Geemap technical issues\n",
    "-   Search Earth Engine API documentation within Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "-   Introduction to interactive maps and tools\n",
    "-   Using Earth Data Catalog to access Image and Image collections\n",
    "-   Using Earth Data Catalog to access Feature and Feature collections\n",
    "-   Display EE images and feature data and explore their properties\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To use geemap and the Earth Engine Python API, you must [register](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) for an Earth Engine account and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGSmrNm6_baqd8CHt33kIBWOlvkh-HLr46bODgJN1h0/edit?usp=sharing) to create a Cloud Project. Earth Engine is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). To test whether you can use authenticate the Earth Engine Python API, please run [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/giswqs/geemap/blob/master/examples/notebooks/geemap_colab.ipynb) on Google Colab.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) is a cloud-computing platform for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets. It is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). For more than a decade, Earth Engine has enabled planetary-scale Earth data science and analysis by nonprofit organizations, research scientists, and other impact users.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the launch of Earth Engine for [commercial use](https://earthengine.google.com/commercial), commercial customers will be charged for Earth Engine services. However, Earth Engine will remain free of charge for noncommercial use and research projects. Nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, educators, news media, Indigenous governments, and government researchers are eligible to use Earth Engine free of charge, just as they have done for over a decade.\n",

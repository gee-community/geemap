    "## Introduction  (10 mins)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is for the tutorial presented at the [SciPy 2023](https://www.scipy2023.org/) Conference by Qiusheng Wu and Steve Greenberg. Check out [this link](https://cfp.scipy.org/2023/talk/GQ7PG3/) for more information about the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to cloud-based geospatial analysis with Earth Engine and the geemap Python package. We will cover the basics of Earth Engine data types and how to visualize, analyze, and export Earth Engine data in a Jupyter environment using geemap. We will also demonstrate how to develop and deploy interactive Earth Engine web apps. Throughout the session, practical examples and hands-on exercises will be provided to enhance learning. The attendees should have a basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Familiarity with Earth science and geospatial datasets is not required, but will be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To use geemap and the Earth Engine Python API, you must [register](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) for an Earth Engine account and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGSmrNm6_baqd8CHt33kIBWOlvkh-HLr46bODgJN1h0/edit?usp=sharing) to create a Cloud Project. Earth Engine is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). To test whether you can use authenticate the Earth Engine Python API, please run [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/docs/notebooks/geemap_colab.ipynb) on Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Python Programming Level of Knowledge Expected\n",
    "\n",
    "The attendees are expected to have a basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebook. Familiarity with Earth science and geospatial datasets is not necessary, but it will be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### G4G Summit Tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "We offer two [Geo for Good (G4G) Summit](https://earthoutreachonair.withgoogle.com/events/geoforgood23) tickets to attendees of the EE SciPy workshop. The G4G Summit will be held on October 11-12, 2023, at the Google campus in Mountain View, CA. The link to express your interest in the tickets will be provided during the workshop. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Earth Engine and geemap (15 mins)\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth Engine is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). For more than a decade, Earth Engine has enabled planetary-scale Earth data science and analysis by nonprofit organizations, research scientists, and other impact users.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the launch of Earth Engine for [commercial use](https://earthengine.google.com/commercial), commercial customers will be charged for Earth Engine services. However, Earth Engine will remain free of charge for noncommercial use and research projects. Nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, educators, news media, Indigenous governments, and government researchers are eligible to use Earth Engine free of charge, just as they have done for over a decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geemap Python package is built upon the Earth Engine Python API and open-source mapping libraries. It allows Earth Engine users to interactively manipulate, analyze, and visualize geospatial big data in a Jupyter environment. Since its creation in April 2020, geemap has received over 2,700 GitHub stars and is being used by over 900 projects on GitHub. \n",

For example, enter \"elevation\" in the search box will filter the catalog to show only datasets containing \"elevation\" in their name, description, or tags. 52 datasets are returned for this search query. Scroll down the list to find the [NASA SRTM Digital Elevation 30m](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_SRTMGL1_003#description) dataset. On each dataset page, you can find the following information, including Dataset Availability, Dataset Provider, Earth Engine Snippet, Tags, Description, Code Example, and more (see {numref}`ch03_gee_srtm`). One important piece of information is the Image/ImageCollection/FeatureCollection ID of each dataset, which is essential for accessing the dataset through the Earth Engine JavaScript or Python APIs.\n",

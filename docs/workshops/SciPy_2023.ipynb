    "**An Introduction to Cloud-Based Geospatial Analysis with Earth Engine and Geemap**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is for the tutorial presented at the [SciPy 2023](https://www.scipy2023.org/) Conference by Qiusheng Wu and Steve Greenberg. Check out [this link](https://cfp.scipy.org/2023/talk/GQ7PG3/) for more information about the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to cloud-based geospatial analysis with Earth Engine and the geemap Python package. We will cover the basics of Earth Engine data types and how to visualize, analyze, and export Earth Engine data in a Jupyter environment using geemap. We will also demonstrate how to develop and deploy interactive Earth Engine web apps. Throughout the session, practical examples and hands-on exercises will be provided to enhance learning. The attendees should have a basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Familiarity with Earth science and geospatial datasets is not required, but will be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth is constantly changing, which creates significant challenges for the environment and human society. To tackle these challenges on a global scale, the Earth science community relies heavily on geospatial datasets that are collected through various means, such as satellite, aerial, and mobile sensors. However, the explosive growth of geospatial datasets over the past few decades has overwhelmed the Earth science community's capacity for storage, analysis, and visualization. Fortunately, the advent of cloud-computing platforms (e.g., Google Earth Engine) has made it possible to access, manipulate, and analyze large volumes of geospatial data on-the-fly. In recent years, Earth Engine has become increasingly popular in the geospatial community and has enabled numerous Earth science applications at local, regional, and global scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geemap Python package is built upon the Earth Engine Python API and open-source mapping libraries. It allows Earth Engine users to interactively manipulate, analyze, and visualize geospatial big data in a Jupyter environment. Since its creation in April 2020, geemap has received over [2,500 GitHub stars](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap/stargazers) and is being used by over [800 projects](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap/network/dependents) on GitHub. More than [130 Jupyter notebook examples](https://geemap.org/tutorials/) and an [open-access book](https://book.geemap.org/) are available for learning geemap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial consists of seven 30-minute sessions and three 10-minute breaks. During each hands-on session, the attendees will walk through Jupyter notebook examples on Google Colab with the instructors. At the end of each session, they will complete a hands-on exercise to apply the knowledge they have learned. The topics that will be covered in this tutorial include: (1) Introduction to Earth Engine and geemap; (2) Using Earth Engine data; (3) Visualizing Earth Engine data; (4) Analyzing Earth Engine data; (5) Exporting Earth Engine data; (6) Creating satellite timelapse animations; and (7) Developing and deploying interactive Earth Engine web apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is intended for scientific programmers, data scientists, geospatial analysts, and concerned citizens of Earth. Attendees should have a basic understanding of Python and the Jupyter ecosystem. Familiarity with Earth science and geospatial datasets is not necessary, but it will be helpful.

    "\n",
    "The [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) hosts a variety of geospatial datasets. As of March 2023, the catalog contains over [1,000 datasets](https://github.com/samapriya/Earth-Engine-Datasets-List) with a total size of over 40 petabytes. Some notable datasets include: Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, NAIP, etc. For a complete list of datasets in CSV or JSON formats, see the [Earth Engine Datasets List](https://github.com/giswqs/Earth-Engine-Catalog/blob/master/gee_catalog.tsv).\n",

    "#### Searching for datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog) is searchable. You can search datasets by name, keyword, or tag. For example, enter \"elevation\" in the search box will filter the catalog to show only datasets containing \"elevation\" in their name, description, or tags. 52 datasets are returned for this search query. Scroll down the list to find the [NASA SRTM Digital Elevation 30m](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_SRTMGL1_003#description) dataset. On each dataset page, you can find the following information, including Dataset Availability, Dataset Provider, Earth Engine Snippet, Tags, Description, Code Example, and more (see {numref}`ch03_gee_srtm`). One important piece of information is the Image/ImageCollection/FeatureCollection ID of each dataset, which is essential for accessing the dataset through the Earth Engine JavaScript or Python APIs.\n",

## Install using uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) is an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for pip. You can install geospatial using uv as follows:

```bash
uv pip install geemap
```

## Install from PyPI

**Geemap** is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geemap/). To install **geemap**, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install geemap
```

## Install from conda-forge

**Geemap** is also available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/geemap). If you have
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda) installed on your computer, you can install geemap using the following command:

```

The geemap package has some optional dependencies, such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org) and [localtileserver](https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver). These optional dependencies can be challenging to install on some computers, especially Windows. It is highly recommended that you create a fresh conda environment to install geemap. Follow the commands below to set up a conda env and install geemap:

```bash
conda create -n gee python=3.11
conda activate gee
conda install -n base mamba -c conda-forge
mamba install geemap -c conda-forge
mamba install geopandas localtileserver -c conda-forge
```

The optional dependencies can be installed using one of the following:

-   `pip install geemap[all]`: installing all optional dependencies.
-   `pip install geemap[backends]`: installing keplergl, pydeck.
-   `pip install geemap[lidar]`: installing ipygany, ipyvtklink, laspy, panel, pyntcloud[LAS], pyvista.
-   `pip install geemap[raster]`: installing localtileserver, rio-cogeo, rioxarray, netcdf4, xarray_leaflet.

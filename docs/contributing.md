### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

geemap could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official geemap docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at <https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
-   Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

## Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up _geemap_ for local development.

1. Fork the [geemap](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap) repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/geemap.git
    ```

3. Install your local copy into a conda env. Assuming you have conda installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:

    ```
    conda create -n geemap-test python
    ```

    ```
    conda activate geemap-test
    ```

    ```
    cd geemap/
    ```

    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

    ```
    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:

    ```
    flake8 geemap tests
    ```

    ```
    python setup.py test or pytest
    ```

    To get pflake8 and tox, just pip install them into your conda env (`pip install pyproject-flake8` and `pip install tox`).

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```
    git add .
    ```

    ```
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    ```

    ```
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and for PyPy. Check <https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/actions> and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

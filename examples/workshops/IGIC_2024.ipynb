    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the materials for the workshop **Intro to Earth Engine in Python** at the 2024 Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC) Annual Conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop provides an introduction to cloud-based geospatial analysis using the Earth Engine Python API. Attendees will learn the basics of Earth Engine data types and how to visualize, analyze, and export Earth Engine data in a Jupyter environment with geemap. In addition, attendees will learn how to develop and deploy interactive Earth Engine web apps with Python. Through practical examples and hands-on exercises, attendees will enhance their learning experience. It is recommended that attendees have a basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebook. Familiarity with the Earth Engine JavaScript API is not required but will be helpful. Attendees can use Google Colab to follow this workshop without installing anything on their computer.\n",

    "-   To use geemap and the Earth Engine Python API, you must [register](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) for an Earth Engine account and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGSmrNm6_baqd8CHt33kIBWOlvkh-HLr46bODgJN1h0/edit?usp=sharing) to create a Cloud Project. Earth Engine is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). To test whether you can use authenticate the Earth Engine Python API, please run [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/giswqs/geemap/blob/master/examples/notebooks/geemap_colab.ipynb) on Google Colab.\n",

    "### Google Earth Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) is a cloud-computing platform for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets. It is free for [noncommercial and research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial). For more than a decade, Earth Engine has enabled planetary-scale Earth data science and analysis by nonprofit organizations, research scientists, and other impact users.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the launch of Earth Engine for [commercial use](https://earthengine.google.com/commercial), commercial customers will be charged for Earth Engine services. However, Earth Engine will remain free of charge for noncommercial use and research projects. Nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, educators, news media, Indigenous governments, and government researchers are eligible to use Earth Engine free of charge, just as they have done for over a decade.\n",

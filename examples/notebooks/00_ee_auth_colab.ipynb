    "\n",
    "1. Locate the Earth Engine token on your computer by navigating to the following file path based on your operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Windows: C:\\\\Users\\\\USERNAME\\\\.config\\\\earthengine\\\\credentials\n",
    "    - Linux: /home/USERNAME/.config/earthengine/credentials\n",
    "    - MacOS: /Users/USERNAME/.config/earthengine/credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open the credentials file and copy the entire content to the clipboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Note:** Ensure that you do not share the content of the credentials file with others to prevent unauthorized access to your Earth Engine account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Creating the Secret in Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your Google Colab notebook and click on the `secrets` tab.\n",
    "2. Create a new secret with the name `EARTHENGINE_TOKEN`.\n",
    "3. Paste the content from the clipboard into the `Value` input box of the created secret.\n",
    "4. Toggle the button on the left to allow notebook access to the secret.\n",
